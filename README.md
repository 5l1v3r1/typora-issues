# Typora

[Typora](http://typora.io) is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and writing markdown. It is currently in beta.

Typora is commercial software (not open source), but is free during beta. [Typora on GitHub](https://github.com/typora) supports collaboration between its developer, [Abner Lee](http://abnerlee.github.io), and its *user community*, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect feedback and discuss future direction. It also provides open source resources for user customization of themes.

# What this Repository is for

This repository exists as a public forum to gather users' feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features or desired enhancements. For questions on how to use Typora, see [How to find support](#how-to-find-support).

While you can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, I and the Typora community prefer you use this public forum for the sake of transparency and efficiency.  

As a developer I want to make Typora perfect, so I welcome all user opinions.

# How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

2. Search the existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it. 
3. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
4. If no one has, click the `New Issue` button and explain. For bug reports, **please provide your OS version, Typora version, and if possible, detailed steps to reproduce the bug**.
5. If you have more than one bug reports or requirements, please seperate them in different issues if they are not closely related.
