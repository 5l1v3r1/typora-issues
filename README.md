# Typora

[Typora](http://typora.io)(beta) is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and writing markdown.

# What's this Repository for

This repository is created to as an alternative way to gather users' feedbacks and discussions.

Currently, user can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, but to increase the transparency of the beta sutiation, a public forum is a better option. User should know exisiting bugs reported by other users (since beta is not so stable) and future developing plans if they want to use typora in long term or pre-order typora before the real release.

Aslo, as a developer, I want to make typora prefect, so a new approach to listener to user's opinion is always welcomed.
