# Typora

[Typora](http://typora.io) (beta) is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and writing markdown.

# What this Repository is for

This repository has been created as an alternative way to gather users' feedback and discussions.

Currently, users can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, but to increase the transparency of the beta situation, a public forum is a better option. Users should read exisiting bugs reported by other users first (since the beta is not so stable).

Also, as a developer, I want to make typora perfect, so a new approach to listen to user's opinions is always welcome.
