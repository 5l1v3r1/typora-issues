# What this Repository is for

This repository exists as a public forum to gather users' feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features or desired enhancements. For questions on how to use Typora, see *How to find support* below.

While you can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, I and the Typora community prefer you use this public forum for the sake of transparency and efficiency.  

As a developer I want to make Typora perfect, so I welcome all user opinions.

# How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues)
2. Search the existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it. 
3. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
4. If no one has, click the `New Issue` button and explain. For bug reports, please provide your OS version and Typora version and if possible, detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you have multiple issues and bug reports and they are not closely related, we recommend you to separate them in different issues.
